      <h1>Collage</h1>
      <p>I created my first digital collage in 2006. After having collected all sorts of things since childhood, the flamboyant wig wearing gentleman was responsible for turning my collections into a creative laboratory. I found him on a leaflet in Barcelona, announcing some major gay disco event. When I came back home, he just fit right in with the glossy collectable pictures I had gotten from my sister as a kid. In the background I put a starry sky and space rockets from my father's old trading cards collection. The resulting piece can be seen underneath.
